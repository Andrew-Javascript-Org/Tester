# Contributing guide

**Want to contribute? Great!** âœ¨ We try to make it easy, and all contributions, even the smaller ones, are more than welcome. This includes bug reports, fixes, documentation, examples... 

First, you may need to read our [global contribution guide](https://github.com/microcks/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and then to read this page.

## Reporting an issue

This project uses GitHub issues to manage the issues. Open an issue directly in GitHub.

If you believe you found a bug, and it's likely possible, please indicate a way to reproduce it, what you are seeing and what you would expect to see.
Don't forget to indicate your Java, Maven and/or Docker version.

## Setup

## Build

### Build the whole project

You need to have [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) (version >= 3.5) up and running as well as a valid Java Development Kit (version >= 17) install to build the project.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/microcks/microcks.git
[...]
$ cd microcks
$ mvn clean install
[...]

### Build and run webapp jar

For now, there's still a problem with Frontend integration tests configuration so you should disable them using the following flag:
 
```
$ cd webapp
$ mvn -Pprod package
[...]
$ java -jar target/microcks-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Build and run webapp Docker image

```
$ cd webapp
$ mvn -Pprod clean package docker:build
[...]
$ cd ../install/docker-compose
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
After spinning up the containers, you will now have access to Keycloak for account management, and microcks webapp to setup mocking, etc.

You can login to keycloak on `http://localhost:18080/` with username and password `admin`.
You can login to microcks webapp with the username `admin` and password `microcks123`.
